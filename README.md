# Kitti3 - Kitty drop down terminal service for i3wm

## Usage
```commandline
$ kitti3
```

### An example

### Configuration

## End user installation

## Development setup
The project adopts a `setuptools` based structure and can therefore be installed in 
development mode using pip (from the project root directory):
    
    $ pip install -e .

This exposes the `kitti3` entry point script, which starts the Kitty overterm service.
